					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>DIS &#x2022; COVERED is a prototype of a mobile app that can help immigrants connect with others in order to help to connect with the locals easily.</p>
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>Our team was assigned to design a system which can help solve a problem and since our entire team were first generation Canadians it was only natural for us to design a system that can help immigrants.</p>
					<p>Initially we were planning to create an app to encompass all immigrants of Canada but found the research to be out of scope for a term project. With Syrian refugees arriving during that period, we decided to focus on them instead. Our team contacted local organizations that worked with helping the refugees settle to gain more information. We created a journey map an a persona with the information we found to fully understand the struggles and difficulties people go through.</p>
					<div class="svg-container">
						<object type="image/svg+xml" data="img/journey-map.svg"></object>
					</div>
					<p>After our research we found the most difficult part was to narrow down what exactly help immigrants connect with others. Initially we lost sight and ended up focusing on an app that is no different to Google Maps which help local places of worship or ethnic groceries. Those areas would not be able to help connect people, therefore we focused more on a app that focuses more on local event and discussions. Along with several helpful features such as discussion boards and quick translations we had found that our results were much closer to our original vision than our previous iteration.</p>

					<h2>Result</h2>
					<p>Ultimately through this project I learned how sometimes a good idea can cause our team to tunnel vision and lose sight of our goals. Thanks to the numerous tests and constructive criticism from our peers we were able to get back on track. For future iterations hopefully we can create a physical prototype to ensure that there were no huge oversight.</p>

					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>The busines faculty's undergraduate website has become very split up with multiple portals with sets of links in all different areas as time progressed making it increasingly difficult for students to find the latest news and events without newsletter updates. Thus, the BBA program decided to start restructure the website.</p>
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>After the layout was approved, I proceeded to work on the tagging system for WordPress. There were quite a bit of troubleshooting because of my inexperience with PHP, thus I spent a lot of time with trial and error. One of the biggest issues I ran into was how to sort dates and how to create a tagging system from scratch. Each event and application had either an event date or deadline date which were posted on WordPress. The default method of grabbing posts was sorted by post date, but students do not need to necessarily know when each one was posted, but rather when events were and when deadlines were coming close.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>Through a lot of research and troubleshooting to make the sorting and tagging system process more user friendly given that interns (which are changed every 4-8 months) are posting these events, I had to keep it simple and easy to pickup. They only need to put either [event] or [deadline] tags along with a date for instance, 2017-02-13, in this format to organize these events. Therefore even if there were errors made it will not cause a huge issue.</p>
					<h2>Result</h2>
					<p>Through this project I gained experience and expanded my knowledge in PHP. Even though I am interested in programming because I believe designers should be able to execute their ideas, I still do not have a lot of experience with coding. Being able to create this system which I believe can be used in other projects in the futre helps understand PHP more.</p>
